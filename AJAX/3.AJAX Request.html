    <!-- AJAX - Server XMLHttpRequest-->

    <!-- The XMLHttpRequest object is used to request data from a server. -->

    <!-- Send a Request To a Server
    To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:

    xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
    xhttp.send();

    Method	                    Description
    open(method, url, async)	Specifies the type of request

                                method: the type of request: GET or POST
                                url: the server (file) location
                                async: true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous)

    send()	                    Sends the request to the server (used for GET)

    send(string)	            Sends the request to the server (used for POST) -->

    <!-- The url - A File On a Server
        The url parameter of the open() method, is an address to a file on a server:

        xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_test.asp", true);
        The file can be any kind of file, like .txt and .xml, or server scripting files like .asp and .php (which can perform actions on the server before sending the response back). -->

    <!-- Asynchronous - True or False?
        Server requests should be sent asynchronously.

        The async parameter of the open() method should be set to true:

        xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_test.asp", true);
        By sending asynchronously, the JavaScript does not have to wait for the server response, but can instead:

        execute other scripts while waiting for server response
        deal with the response after the response is ready
        The default value for the async parameter is async = true.

        You can safely remove the third parameter from your code.

        Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop. -->

    <!-- GET or POST?
        GET is simpler and faster than POST, and can be used in most cases.

        However, always use POST requests when:

        A cached file is not an option (update a file or database on the server).
        Sending a large amount of data to the server (POST has no size limitations).
        Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and secure than GET. -->

    <!-- GET Requests
        A simple GET request -->
    <button onclick="loadDoc()">Request Data</button>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        function loadDoc() {
            const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

            xhttp.onload = function () {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }

            xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
            xhttp.send();
        }
    </script>

    <!-- POST Requests
        A simple POST request -->
    <!-- To POST data like an HTML form, add an HTTP header with setRequestHeader(). Specify the data you want to send in the send() method-->
    <script>
        function loadDoc() {
            const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhttp.onload = function () {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }
            xhttp.open("POST", "demo_post2.asp");
            xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
            xhttp.send("fname=Henry&lname=Ford");
        }
    </script>
    <!-- Method	Description
        setRequestHeader(header, value)	Adds HTTP headers to the request

                                        header: specifies the header name
                                        value: specifies the header value -->

    <!-- Synchronous Request
        To execute a synchronous request, change the third parameter in the open() method to false:

        xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", false);
        Sometimes async = false are used for quick testing. You will also find synchronous requests in older JavaScript code.

        Since the code will wait for server completion, there is no need for an onreadystatechange function -->

    <button onclick="loadDoc()">Request Data</button>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        function loadDoc() {
            const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

            xhttp.onload = function () {
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }

            xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", false);
            xhttp.send();
        }
    </script>
    <!-- Synchronous XMLHttpRequest (async = false) is not recommended because the JavaScript will stop executing until the server response is ready. If the server is busy or slow, the application will hang or stop.

    Modern developer tools are encouraged to warn about using synchronous requests and may throw an InvalidAccessError exception when it occurs. -->
