    <!-- JavaScript Object Methods -->

    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
            fullname: function () {
                return this.firstname + " " + this.lastname;
            }
        };
        console.log(person);
    </script>

    <!-- The this Keyword
        In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
        In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
        In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Methods
        JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
        A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

        Property	Value
        firstName	John
        lastName	Doe
        age	        50
        eyeColor	blue
        fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
        
        Methods are functions stored as object properties.

        Accessing Object Methods
        You access an object method with the following syntax:

        objectName.methodName()
        You will typically describe fullName() as a method of the person object, and fullName as a property.
        The fullName property will execute (as a function) when it is invoked with ().
        This example accesses the fullName() method of a person object: -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
            fullname: function () {
                return this.firstname + " " + this.lastname;
            }
        };
        console.log(person.fullname());
        console.log(person.fullname);
    </script>

    <!-- Adding a Method to an Object
        Adding a new method to an object is easy -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
        };
        person.name = function () {
            return this.firstname + " " + this.lastname;
        };
        console.log(person.name());
    </script>

    <!-- Using Built-In Methods
        This example uses the toUpperCase() method of the String object, to convert a text to uppercase:

        let message = "Hello world!";
        let x = message.toUpperCase();
        The value of x, after execution of the code above will be:

        HELLO WORLD!
        Example -->

    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
        };
        person.name = function () {
            return (this.firstname + " " + this.lastname).toUpperCase();
        };
        console.log(person.name());
    </script>
