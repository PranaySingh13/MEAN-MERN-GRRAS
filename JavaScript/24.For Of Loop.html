    <!-- The For/Of Loop
    The JavaScript for/of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
    It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more -->

    <!-- Syntax
        for (variable of iterable) {
        // code block to be executed
        }
        variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.
        iterable - An object that has iterable properties. -->

    <!-- Looping over an Array -->
    <script>
        let cars = ["audi", "bmw", "tesla"];
        let text = "";
        for (const iterator of cars) {
            text += iterator + "\n";
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>

    <!-- Looping over a String -->
    <script>
        let language = "American English";
        let result = "";
        for (const iterator of language) {
            result += iterator + " ";
        }
        console.log(result);
    </script>
