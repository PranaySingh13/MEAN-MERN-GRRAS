    <!-- JavaScript While Loop -->
    <!-- Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. -->

    <!-- The While Loop
    The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

    Syntax
    while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
    } -->
    <script>
        let i = prompt("Enter the Value");
        let text = "";
        while (i < 10) {
            text += "The number is " + i + " \n";
            i++;
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>
    <!-- If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. -->

    <!-- The Do/While Loop
    The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. -->

    <!-- Syntax
    do {
    // code block to be executed
    }
    while (condition); -->

    <!-- The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is testedThe example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested -->
    <script>
        let a = prompt("Enter the Number", "value");//check for value 10 or more
        let result = "";
        do {
            result += "The number is " + a + " \n";
            a++;
        } while (a < 10);
        console.log(result);
    </script>
    <!-- Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end! -->

    <!-- Comparing For and While
    If you have read the previous chapter, about the for loop, you will discover that a while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted. -->
