    <!-- JavaScript For Loop -->

    <!-- JavaScript Loops
    Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value. -->

    <!-- Different Kinds of Loops
        JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

        for - loops through a block of code a number of times
        for/in - loops through the properties of an object
        for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
        while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true -->

    <!-- The For Loop
        The for loop has the following syntax:

        for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
        // code block to be executed
        }

        Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
        Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
        Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. -->
    <script>
        var text = "";
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "The number is " + i + "\n";
        }
        //Complete Text String is created until the loop completes then the final result string is returns to the browser.
        console.log(text);
    </script>

    <!-- From the example above, you can read:
        Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).
        Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).
        Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed. -->

    <!-- Statement 1
        Normally you will use statement 1 to initialize the variable used in the loop (i = 0).
        
        This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 1 is optional.
        
        You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma) -->
    <script>
        var text = "";
        var i = 0;
        for (; i < 5; i++) {
            text += "The number is " + i + "\n";
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>
    <script>

        for (var b = 0, text = ""; b < 5; b++) {
            text += "The number is " + b + "\n";
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>

    <!-- Statement 2
        Often statement 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable.
        
        This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care. Statement 2 is also optional.
        
        If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.
        If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser. -->

    <!-- Statement 3
        Often statement 3 increments the value of the initial variable.
        
        This is not always the case, JavaScript doesn't care, and statement 3 is optional.
        
        Statement 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.
        Statement 3 can also be omitted (like when you increment your values inside the loop) -->
    <script>
        var text = "";
        var i = 0;
        for (; i < 5;) {
            text += "The number is " + i + "\n";
            i++
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>
