    <!-- JavaScript Operators -->

    <!-- Arithmetic Operators -->
    <!-- Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

        Operator	Description
        +	        Addition
        -	        Subtraction
        *	        Multiplication
        **	        Exponentiation (ES2016)
        /	        Division
        %	        Modulus (Remainder)
        ++	        Increment
        --	        Decrement 
    -->

    <!-- Adding 
    The addition operator (+) adds numbers -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var y = 4;
        var z = x + y;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Subtracting
    The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var y = 2;
        var z = x - y;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Multiplying
    The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var y = 2;
        var z = x * y;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Dividing
    The division operator (/) divides numbers. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var y = 2;
        var z = x / y;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Remainder
    The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var y = 2;
        var z = x % y;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Incrementing
    The increment operator (++) increments numbers. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        x++;
        var z = x;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Decrementing
    The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        x--;
        var z = x;
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Exponentiation(New Features in ECMAScript 2016)
    The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        var z = x ** 2;          // result is 25
        console.log(z);
    </script>

    <!-- Operator Precedence
    Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. -->

    <!-- Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). -->
    <script>
        var x = 100 + 50 * 3;
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first. -->
    <script>
        var x = (100 + 50) * 3;
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right -->
    <script>
        var x = 100 + 50 - 3;
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- Assignment Operators -->
    <!-- Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables. -->

    <!-- Operator	Example	    Same As
            =	    x = y	    x = y
            +=	    x+= y	    x = x + y
            -=	    x -= y	    x = x - y
            *=	    x *= y	    x = x * y
            /=	    x /= y	    x = x / y
            %=	    x %= y	    x = x % y
            <<=	    x <<= y	    x = x << y
            >>=	    x >>= y	    x = x >> y
            >>>=	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y
            &=	    x &= y	    x = x & y
            ^=	    x ^= y	    x = x ^ y

        var x = 10;

        // The /= assignment divides a variable.
        var x = 10;
        x /= 5;
        console.log(x);

        // The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable.
        var x = 10;
        x %= 5;
        console.log(x);

        // Exponentiation Assignment(New Features in ECMAScript 2016)
        // The exponentiation assignment operator (**=) raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.
        var x = 5;
        x **= 2; // result 25
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- Note :
        Go Through Boolean in Javascript before Comparison and Logical Operators -->

    <!-- Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false. -->

    <!-- Comparison Operators
    Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. -->
    <script>
        var x = 5;
        // == equal to
        console.log(x == 8);
        console.log(x == 5);

        // ===	equal value and equal type
        console.log(x === 8);
        console.log(x === 5);
        console.log(x === "5");

        // !=	not equal
        console.log(x != 8);
        console.log(x != 5);
        console.log(x != "5");

        //  !==	not equal value or not equal type
        console.log(x !== 8);
        console.log(x !== 5);
        console.log(x !== "5");

        //  >	greater than
        console.log(x > 8);

        //  <	less than
        console.log(x < 8);

        //  >=	greater than or equal to
        console.log(x >= 8);

        //  <=	less than or equal to
        console.log(x <= 8);
    </script>

    <!-- Logical Operators
    Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. -->
    <script>
        var x = 6, y = 3;

        //&&	and(both condition should be true for result to be true)
        console.log(x < 10 && y > 1);

        //||	or(any one condition should be true for result to be true)
        console.log(x < 10 || y > 4);
        console.log(x < 5 || y > 4);

        //!	not
        console.log(!(x == y));
    </script>

    <!-- Conditional (Ternary) Operator
    JavaScript also contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition. -->

    <!-- Syntax
    variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2  -->
    <script>
        var age = 15;
        var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
        console.log(voteable);
    </script>

    <!-- Comparing Different Types
    Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results.
    When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false. -->

    <!-- Note: -->
    <!-- When comparing two strings, "2" will be greater than "12", because (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2.
    To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison -->
    <script>
        console.log(2 < "");
        console.log(2 == "John");
        console.log(2 < "12");

        var age = 10;
        age = Number(age);
        if (isNaN(age)) {
            voteable = "Input is not a number";
        } else {
            voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
        }
        console.log(voteable);

        var age = "10";
        age = Number(age);
        if (isNaN(age)) {
            voteable = "Input is not a number";
        } else {
            voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
        }
        console.log(voteable);

        var age = "10s";
        age = Number(age);
        if (isNaN(age)) {
            voteable = "Input is not a number";
        } else {
            voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
        }
