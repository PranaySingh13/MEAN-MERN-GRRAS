    <!-- JavaScript Regular Expressions -->

    <!-- A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
    The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.-->

    <!-- What Is a Regular Expression?
        A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
        When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
        A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
        Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

        Syntax
        /pattern/modifiers;
        Example
        var patt = /w3schools/i;
        Example explained:

        /w3schools/i  is a regular expression.
        w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search).
        i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).-->

    <!-- Using String Methods
        In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().
        The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
        The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced. -->

    <!-- Using String search() With a String
    The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match -->
    <script>
        //Use a string to do a search for "W3schools" in a string
        var str = "Visit W3Schools!";
        console.log(str.search("W3Schools"));//6
    </script>

    <!-- Using String search() With a Regular Expression -->
    <script>
        //Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string
        var str = "Visit W3Schools!";
        console.log(str.search(/w3schools/i));//6
    </script>

    <!-- Using String replace() With a String
    The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string -->
    <script>
        var str = "Visit Microsoft!";
        console.log(str.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools"));
    </script>

    <!-- Use String replace() With a Regular Expression -->
    <!-- Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string: -->
    <script>
        var str = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!";
        console.log(str.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools"));
    </script>
