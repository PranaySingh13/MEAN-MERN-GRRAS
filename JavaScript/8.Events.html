    <!-- JavaScript Events -->
    <!-- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
    When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events. -->
    
    <!-- HTML Events
    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

        Here are some examples of HTML events:

        An HTML web page has finished loading
        An HTML input field was changed
        An HTML button was clicked

    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements. -->

    <!-- With single quotes:
    <element event='some JavaScript'>

    With double quotes:
    <element event="some JavaScript"> -->
       
    <!-- In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element: -->
    <!-- In the example, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo". -->
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is ?</button>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <!-- In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML -->
    <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is ?</button>

    <!-- JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions -->
    <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>
    <script>
        function displayDate(){
            document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML=Date();
        }
    </script>
    <p id="demo1"></p>
