    <!-- JavaScript Class Inheritance -->

    <!-- Class Inheritance
        To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
        A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:

        Example
        Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class -->

    <script>
        class Car {
            constructor(brand) {
                this.carName = brand;
            }
            present() {
                return 'I have a ' + this.carName;
            }
        }
        class Model extends Car {
            constructor(brand, mod) {
                super(brand);
                this.model = mod;
            }
            show() {
                return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model + '.';
            }
        }
        let myCar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
        document.write(myCar.show());
    </script>
    <!-- The super() method refers to the parent class.
        By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods.
        Inheritance is useful for code reusability: reuse properties and methods of an existing class when you create a new class. -->

    <!-- Getters and Setters
        Classes also allows you to use getters and setters.
        It can be smart to use getters and setters for your properties, especially if you want to do something special with the value before returning them, or before you set them.
        To add getters and setters in the class, use the get and set keywords. -->

    <!-- Example
    Create a getter and a setter for the "bikename" property -->
    <script>
        class Bike {

            constructor(brand) {
                this.bikeName = brand;
            }

            set bName(x) {
                this.bikeName = x;
            }

            get bName() {
                return this.bikeName;
            }
        }

        let myBike = new Bike("Royal Enfield");
        document.write("<br>" + myBike.bName);
    </script>
    <!-- Note: even if the getter is a method, you do not use parentheses when you want to get the property value. -->

    <script>
        class Cycle {
            constructor(brand) {
                this._cycleName = brand;
            }
            set cName(x) {
                this._cycleName = x;
            }

            get cName() {
                return this._cycleName;
            }
        }

        let myCycle = new Cycle("Razorback");
        document.write("<br>" + myCycle.cName);
    </script>
    <!-- To use a setter, use the same syntax as when you set a property value, without parentheses -->
    <!-- Example
        Use a setter to change the carname to "Volvo" -->

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <!-- The name of the getter/setter method cannot be the same as the name of the property, in this case carname.
        Many programmers use an underscore character _ before the property name to separate the getter/setter from the actual property -->

    <script>
        class Plane {
            constructor(brand) {
                this._planeName = brand;
            }
            set planeName(x) {
                this._planeName = x;
            }

            get planeName() {
                return this._planeName;
            }
        }

        let myPlane1 = new Plane("Indigo");
        document.write("<br>" + myPlane1.planeName);

        myPlane1.planeName = "SpiceJet";
        document.write("<br>" + myPlane1.planeName);
    </script>

    <!-- Hoisting
        Unlike functions, and other JavaScript declarations, class declarations are not hoisted.
        That means that you must declare a class before you can use it -->


    <script>
        //You cannot use the class yet.
        //myCar = new Car("Ford")
        //This would raise an error.

        class Car {
            constructor(brand) {
                this.carname = brand;
            }
        }

        //Now you can use the class:
        let myCar = new Car("Ford")
    </script>
    <!-- Note: For other declarations, like functions, you will NOT get an error when you try to use it before it is
    declared, because the default behavior of JavaScript declarations are hoisting (moving the declaration to the top).   -->
