    <!-- JavaScript Date Formats -->

    <!-- JavaScript Date Input
    There are generally 3 types of JavaScript date input formats -->

    <!--Type	    Example
        ISO Date	"2015-03-25" (The International Standard)
        Short Date	"03/25/2015"
        Long Date	"Mar 25 2015" or "25 Mar 2015" -->

    <!-- The ISO format follows a strict standard in JavaScript.
    The other formats are not so well defined and might be browser specific. -->

    <!-- JavaScript ISO Dates
    ISO 8601 is the international standard for the representation of dates and times.

    The ISO 8601 syntax (YYYY-MM-DD) is also the preferred JavaScript date format -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015-03-25");
        console.log(d);
    </script>
    <!-- The computed date will be relative to your time zone.
    Depending on your time zone, the result above will vary between March 24 and March 25. -->

    <!-- ISO Dates (Year and Month)
    ISO dates can be written without specifying the day (YYYY-MM) -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015-03");
        console.log(d);
    </script>
    <!-- Time zones will vary the result above between February 28 and March 01. -->

    <!-- ISO Dates (Only Year)
    ISO dates can be written without month and day (YYYY) -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>
    <!-- Time zones will vary the result above between December 31 2014 and January 01 2015. -->

    <!-- ISO Dates (Date-Time)
    ISO dates can be written with added hours, minutes, and seconds (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00Z");
        console.log(d);
    </script>
    <!-- Date and time is separated with a capital T.
    UTC time is defined with a capital letter Z.
    If you want to modify the time relative to UTC, remove the Z and add +HH:MM or -HH:MM instead -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00-06:30");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). -->
    <!-- Omitting T or Z in a date-time string can give different results in different browsers. -->

    <!-- Omitting T or Z in a date-time string can give different results in different browsers. -->

    <!-- Time Zones
    When setting a date, without specifying the time zone, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone.
    When getting a date, without specifying the time zone, the result is converted to the browser's time zone. -->

    <!-- In other words: If a date/time is created in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), the date/time will be converted to CDT (Central US Daylight Time) if a user browses from central US. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Short Dates.
    Short dates are written with an "MM/DD/YYYY" syntax like this -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("03/25/2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- WARNINGS ! -->
    <!-- The behavior of "YYYY/MM/DD" is undefined.
    Some browsers will try to guess the format. Some will return NaN. -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("2015/03/25");
        console.log(d);
    </script>
    <!-- The behavior of  "DD-MM-YYYY" is also undefined.
    Some browsers will try to guess the format. Some will return NaN. -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("25-03-2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- JavaScript Long Dates. -->
    <!-- Long dates are most often written with a "MMM DD YYYY" syntax like this -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("Mar 25 2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- Month and day can be in any order -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("25 Mar 2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- And, month can be written in full (January), or abbreviated (Jan) -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("January 25 2015");
        console.log(d);
        var d = new Date("Jan 25 2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- Commas are ignored. Names are case insensitive -->
    <script>
        var d = new Date("JANUARY, 25, 2015");
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <!-- Date Input - Parsing Dates
    If you have a valid date string, you can use the Date.parse() method to convert it to milliseconds.
    Date.parse() returns the number of milliseconds between the date and January 1, 1970 -->
    <script>
        var msec = Date.parse("April 30, 2021");
        console.log(msec);
    </script>
