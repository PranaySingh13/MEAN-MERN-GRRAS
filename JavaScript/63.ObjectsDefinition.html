    <!-- JavaScript Objects -->

    <!-- In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript. -->

    <!-- In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

        Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        Dates are always objects
        Maths are always objects
        Regular expressions are always objects
        Arrays are always objects
        Functions are always objects
        Objects are always objects
        All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

        JavaScript Primitives
        A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

        A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

        JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

        string
        number
        boolean
        null
        undefined
        Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).

        if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x. But you cannot change the value of 3.14.

        Value	Type	Comment
        "Hello"	string	"Hello" is always "Hello"
        3.14	number	3.14 is always 3.14
        true	boolean	true is always true
        false	boolean	false is always false
        null	null (object)	null is always null
        undefined	undefined	undefined is always undefined
        Objects are Variables
        JavaScript variables can contain single values -->
    <script>
        let person = "Pranay Singh";
        console.log(person);
    </script>

    <!-- JavaScript variables can also contain many values.
        Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
        Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
        Example -->
    <script>
        let person1 = { firstname: "Pranay", lastname: "Singh", age: 28 };
        console.log(person1);
    </script>

    <!-- Object Properties
        The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.

        Property	Value
        firstName	John
        lastName	Doe
        age	50
        eyeColor	blue
        Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:

        Associative arrays in PHP
        Dictionaries in Python
        Hash tables in C
        Hash maps in Java
        Hashes in Ruby and Perl
        Object Methods
        Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

        Object properties can be both primitive values, other objects, and functions.

        An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

        Property	Value
        firstName	John
        lastName	Doe
        age	50
        eyeColor	blue
        fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
        JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties and methods. -->

    <!-- Creating a JavaScript Object
        With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.

        There are different ways to create new objects:

        Create a single object, using an object literal.
        Create a single object, with the keyword new.
        Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
        Create an object using Object.create(). -->

    <!-- Using an Object Literal
        This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.
        Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.
        An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
        The following example creates a new JavaScript object with four properties -->
    <script>
        let person2 = { firstname: "Pranay", lastname: "Singh", age: 28 };
        console.log(person2);
    </script>

    <!-- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines -->
    <script>
        let person3 = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 50,
            eyeColor: "blue"
        };
        console.log(person3);
    </script>

    <!-- This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 4 properties -->
    <script>
        let person4 = {};
        person4.firstName = "John";
        person4.lastName = "Doe";
        person4.age = 50;
        person4.eyeColor = "blue";
        console.log(person4);
    </script>

    <!-- Using the JavaScript Keyword new
        The following example create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and then adds 4 properties -->
    <script>
        let person5 = new Object();
        person5.firstName = "John";
        person5.lastName = "Doe";
        person5.age = 50;
        person5.eyeColor = "blue";
        console.log(person5);
    </script>

    <!-- V.Imp -->
    <!-- The examples above do exactly the same.

        But there is no need to use new Object().

        For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Objects are Mutable
        Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

        If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

        const x = person;  // Will not create a copy of person.
        The object x is not a copy of person. It is person. Both x and person are the same object.

        Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object. -->

    <script>
        let person6 = {
            firstName: "John",
            lastName: "Doe",
            age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"
        }

        const x = person6;
        x.age = 10;      // Will change both x.age and person.age
        console.log(person6.age, x.age);//10,10
    </script>
