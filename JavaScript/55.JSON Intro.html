    <!-- JSON - Introduction -->

    <!-- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
        JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
        JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand -->

    <!-- JSON Example
        This example defines an object:

        {"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}
        The person object has 3 properties:

        name
        age
        car
        Each property has a value.

        What is JSON?
        JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
        JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation
        JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
        JSON is used to send data between computers
        JSON is language independent *
        *
        The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, but the JSON format is text only.
        Code for reading and generating JSON exists in many programming languages. -->

    <!-- Why Use JSON?
        The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
        Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
        Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.
        JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into native JavaScript objects:

        JSON.parse()

        So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.
        JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:

        JSON.stringify()

        So, you can send JavaScript objects to a server in pure text format. -->

    <!-- Exchanging Data
        When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
        JSON is text, so you can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send the JSON text to a server.
        You can also convert any JSON text received from the server into JavaScript objects in your programs.
        This way you can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.-->

    <!-- Storing Data
        When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.
        JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text. -->
