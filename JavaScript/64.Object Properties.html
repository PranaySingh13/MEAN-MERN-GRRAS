    <!-- JavaScript Object Properties-->
    <!-- Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.-->

    <!-- JavaScript Properties
        Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.
        A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
        Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only. -->

    <!-- Accessing JavaScript Properties
        The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

        objectName.property      // person.age
        or

        objectName["property"]   // person["age"]
        or

        objectName[expression]   // x = "age"; person[x]
        The expression must evaluate to a property name. -->

    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            age: 28
        };
        console.log(person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old");
        console.log(person["firstname"] + " is " + person["age"] + " years old");
    </script>
    <!-- JavaScript for...in Loop
        The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.

        Syntax
        for (let variable in object) {
        // code to be executed
        }
        The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.

        Looping through the properties of an object -->
    <script>
        var text = "";
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28
        };
        for (const key in person) {
            text += person[key] + " ";
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>

    <!-- Adding New Properties
        You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.
        Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties -->

    <script>
        var text = "";
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28
        };
        person.nationality = "Indian";
        person["bloodGroup"] = "A+";
        for (const key in person) {
            text += person[key] + " ";
        }
        console.log(text);
    </script>

    <!-- Deleting Properties
        The delete keyword deletes a property from an object -->
    <script>
        var text = "";
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
            nationality: "Indian",
            bloodGroup: "A+"
        };
        delete person.bloodGroup;
        delete person["nationality"];
        for (const key in person) {
            text += person[key] + " ";
        }
        console.log(text);
        console.log(person);
    </script>

    <!-- The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
    After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
    The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. It has no effect on variables or functions.
    The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties. It can crash your application. -->

    <!-- Nested Objects
        Values in an object can be another object -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstname: "Pranay",
            lastname: "Singh",
            age: 28,
            cars: {
                car1: "Audi",
                car2: "Ferrari",
                car3: "BMW"
            }
        }
        console.log(person.cars.car1);
        console.log(person.cars["car2"]);
        console.log(person["cars"]["car3"]);
    </script>

    <!-- ****Very Important**** -->
    <!-- Nested Arrays and Objects
        Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects: -->
    <!-- To access arrays inside arrays, use a for-in loop for each array -->
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        var text = "";
        var person = {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
            cars: [
                { name: "Ford", "models": ["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"] },
                { name: "BMW", "models": ["320", "X3", "X5"] },
                { name: "Fiat", "models": ["500", "Panda"] }
            ]
        }
        for (const i in person.cars) {
            text += "<h1>" + person.cars[i].name + "</h1>";
            for (const j in person.cars[i].models) {
                text += person.cars[i].models[j] + " ";
            }
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <!-- Property Attributes
        All properties have a name. In addition they also have a value.
        The value is one of the property's attributes.
        Other attributes are: enumerable, configurable, and writable.
        These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?)
        In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if the property is writable).
        ( ECMAScript 5 has methods for both getting and setting all property attributes)

        Prototype Properties
        JavaScript objects inherit the properties of their prototype.
        The delete keyword does not delete inherited properties, but if you delete a prototype property, it will affect all objects inherited from the prototype. -->
