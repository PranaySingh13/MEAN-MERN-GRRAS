    <!-- JavaScript Const -->
    <!-- Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned -->
    <script>
        const PI = 3.141592653589793;
        PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
        PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
    </script>

    <!-- Block Scope
    Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.
    The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block: -->
    <script>
        var x = 10;
        // Here x is 10
        {
            const x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
        }
        // Here x is 10
    </script>

    <!-- Assigned when Declared
    JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared -->
    <script>
        const PI;
        PI = 3.14159265359; //Incorrect

        const PI = 3.14159265359; //Correct
    </script>

    <!-- Note Important -->
    <!-- Not Real Constants
        The keyword const is a little misleading.
        It does NOT define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
        Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects -->

    <!-- Primitive Values
    If we assign a primitive value to a constant, we cannot change the primitive value -->
    <script>
        const PI = 3.141592653589793;
        PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
        PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
    </script>

    <!-- Constant Objects can Change
    You can change the properties of a constant object -->
    <script>
        // You can create a const object:
        const car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };

        // You can change a property:
        car.color = "red";

        // You can add a property:
        car.owner = "Johnson";
        console.log(car);
    </script>

    <!-- But you can NOT reassign a constant object: -->
    <script>
        const car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };
        car = { type: "Volvo", model: "EX60", color: "red" };    // ERROR
    </script>

    <!-- Constant Arrays can Change
    You can change the elements of a constant array -->
    <script>
        // You can create a constant array:
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

        // You can change an element:
        cars[0] = "Toyota";

        // You can add an element:
        cars.push("Audi");
        console.log(cars);
    </script>

    <!-- But you can NOT reassign a constant array: -->
    <script>
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
    </script>

    <script>
        // Redeclaring
        // Redeclaring a JavaScript var variable is allowed anywhere in a program

        var x = 2;    //  Allowed
        var x = 3;    //  Allowed
        x = 4;        //  Allowed

        // Redeclaring or reassigning an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed
        var x = 2;         // Allowed
        const x = 2;       // Not allowed
        {
            let x = 2;     // Allowed
            const x = 2;   // Not allowed
        }

        // Redeclaring or reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed
        const x = 2;       // Allowed
        const x = 3;       // Not allowed
        x = 3;             // Not allowed
        var x = 3;         // Not allowed
        let x = 3;         // Not allowed

        {
            const x = 2;   // Allowed
            const x = 3;   // Not allowed
            x = 3;         // Not allowed
            var x = 3;     // Not allowed
            let x = 3;     // Not allowed
        }

        // Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed
        const x = 2;       // Allowed

        {
            const x = 3;   // Allowed
        }

        {
            const x = 4;   // Allowed
        }

    </script>

    <!-- Hoisting
    Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time -->
    <!-- Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared -->
    <script>
        carName = "Volvo";
        alert(carName);
        var carName; //This is OK
    </script>

    <!-- Variables defined with const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
    Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
    The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared.
    Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run -->
    <script>
        carName = "Volvo";
        const carName; // Error 
    </script>
