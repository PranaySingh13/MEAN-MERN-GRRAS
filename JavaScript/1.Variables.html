    <!-- JavaScript Variables -->
    <!-- JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
    In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword: -->
    <script>
        var x = 4;
        var y = 6;
        var z = x + y;

        //Console.log(); command is used to run the script on browser console when you inspect element the html page
        console.log("Result:- " + z);
    </script>

    <!-- Using let and const (ES6)
        Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.
        The 2015 version of JavaScript (ES6) allows the use of the const keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned, and the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Identifiers
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
        These unique names are called identifiers. -->

    <!-- he general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter
        Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
        Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
        Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names -->

    <!-- The Assignment Operator
    In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. -->

    <!-- The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Data Types
    JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe". -->

    <!-- Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
    If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. -->

    <script>
        var pi = 3.142;
        var firstName = "Person";
        var lastName = 'Singh';
        console.log(pi, firstName, lastName);
    </script>

    <!-- Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables
        Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
        You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword: -->

    <!-- After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).
    To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign: -->

    <!--You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:  -->

    <script>
        var carName = "Rolls Royce";
        console.log(carName);
    </script>

    <!-- One Statement, Many Variables
        You can declare many variables in one statement.
        Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma: -->

    <script>
        var firstName = "Virat", lastName = "Kohli", position = 3;
        console.log(firstName, lastName, position);
    </script>

    <!-- Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
        If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.
        The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements: -->

    <script>
        var carName = "Ferrari";
        var carName;
        console.log(carName);
    </script>

    <!-- JavaScript Arithmetic
    As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and + -->

    <script>
        var x = 5 + 2 + 3;
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated: -->
    <!-- If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. -->
    <script>
        var x = "Pranay" + "Singh";
        var y = "Pranay" + 111;
        console.log(x, y);
    </script>

    <!-- JavaScript Dollar Sign $
    Remember that JavaScript identifiers (names) must begin with:

    A letter (A-Z or a-z)
    A dollar sign ($)
    Or an underscore (_)
    Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names -->

    <!-- ****Note Important**** -->
    <!-- Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.
    In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements". -->

    <script>
        var $$$ = "Hello World";
        var $ = 2;
        var $myMoney = 100000;
        console.log($$$, $, $myMoney);
    </script>

    <!-- JavaScript Underscore (_)
    Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names: -->

    <!-- ****Note Important**** -->
    <!-- Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, but a convention among professional programmers is to use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables. -->
    <script>
        var _lastName = "Singh";
        var _x = 4;
        var _100 = 9;
        console.log(_lastName, _x, _100);
    </script>
