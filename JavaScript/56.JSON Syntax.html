    <!-- JSON Syntax -->

    <!-- The JSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript syntax.

        JSON Syntax Rules
        JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

        Data is in name/value pairs
        Data is separated by commas
        Curly braces hold objects
        Square brackets hold arrays
        JSON Data - A Name and a Value
        JSON data is written as name/value pairs (aka key/value pairs).


        ********VERY IMPORTANT POINTS AND DIFFERNCES********

        A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value:

        Example
        "name":"John"
        JSON names require double quotes.

        JSON - Evaluates to JavaScript Objects
        The JSON format is almost identical to JavaScript objects.

        In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes:

        JSON
        {"name":"John"}
        In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names:

        JavaScript
        {name:"John"}
        JSON Values
        In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

        a string
        a number
        an object
        an array
        a boolean
        null
        In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:

        a function
        a date
        undefined
        In JSON, string values must be written with double quotes:

        JSON
        {"name":"John"}
        In JavaScript, you can write string values with double or single quotes:

        JavaScript
        {name:'John'}
        JavaScript Objects
        Because JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation, very little extra software is needed to work with JSON within JavaScript.

        With JavaScript you can create an object and assign data to it, like this -->

    <!-- Example
        person = {name:"John", age:31, city:"New York"};
        You can access a JavaScript object like this:

        Example
        // returns John
        person.name;
        It can also be accessed like this:

        Example
        // returns John
        person["name"];
        Data can be modified like this:

        Example
        person.name = "Gilbert";
        It can also be modified like this:

        Example
        person["name"] = "Gilbert";
        You will learn how to convert JavaScript objects into JSON later in this tutorial.

        JavaScript Arrays as JSON
        The same way JavaScript objects can be written as JSON, JavaScript arrays can also be written as JSON.

        You will learn more about objects and arrays later in this tutorial.

        JSON Files
        The file type for JSON files is ".json"
        
        //(Multipurpose internet Mail Extension)MIME
        The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json" -->
