<body>
    <!-- JavaScript Objects -->
    <!-- Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. -->
    <!-- The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon). -->
    <script>
        var car = { type: "Fiat", model: "500", color: "white" };
        console.log(car);
    </script>

    <!-- Object Definition
    You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal: -->
    <script>
        var person = { firstName: "Pranay", lastName: "Singh", age: 27, gender: "Male" };
        console.log(person);
    </script>
    <!-- Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines: -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstName: "pranay",
            lastName: "singh",
            age: 27,
            gender: "male"
        };
        console.log(person);
    </script>
    <!-- Object Properties
    The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

        Property	Property Value
        firstName	pranay
        lastName	singh
        age	        27
        gender	    male -->

    <!-- Accessing Object Properties
    You can access object properties in two ways: -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstName: "pranay",
            lastName: "singh",
            age: 27,
            gender: "male"
        };
        //first way
        console.log(person.firstName);

        //second way
        console.log(person["lastName"]);
    </script>

    <!-- Object Methods
        Objects can also have methods.
        Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
        Methods are stored in properties as function definitions. -->

    <!-- V.Imp -->
    <!-- A method is a function stored as a property. -->
    <script>
        var person = {
            firstName: "pranay",
            lastName: "singh",
            fullName: function () {
                return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
            }
        };
    </script>
    <!-- The this Keyword
    In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.
    In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.
    In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object. -->

    <!-- Accessing Object Methods
        You access an object method with the following syntax -->
    <!-- objectName.methodName() -->
    <!-- If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition: -->
    <script>
        console.log(person.fullName());
        console.log(person.fullName);
    </script>
