    <!-- JavaScript Classes-->
    <!-- ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
    JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects. -->

    <!-- JavaScript Class Syntax
        Use the keyword class to create a class.

        Always add a method named constructor():

        Syntax
        class ClassName {
        constructor() { ... }
        } -->

    <!-- Creates a class named "Car".
        The class has two initial properties: "name" and "year".
        A JavaScript class is not an object.
        It is a template for JavaScript objects.
        Using a Class
        When you have a class, you can use the class to create objects -->
    <script>
        class Car {
            constructor(carName, buyYear) {
                this.name = carName;
                this.year = buyYear;
            }
        }
        let myFirstCar = new Car("Audi", 2022);
        let mySecondCar = new Car("Mercedes", 2024);
        document.write("I will buy my first car " + myFirstCar.name + " in " + myFirstCar.year + ".<br>");
        document.write("I will buy my second car " + mySecondCar.name + " in " + mySecondCar.year + ".<br>");
    </script>
    <!-- The example above uses the Car class to create two Car objects.
        The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created. -->

    <!-- The Constructor Method
        The constructor method is a special method:

        It has to have the exact name "constructor"
        It is executed automatically when a new object is created
        It is used to initialize object properties
        If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method. -->

    <!-- Class Methods
        Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

        Use the keyword class to create a class.
        Always add a constructor() method.
        Then add any number of methods. -->

    <!-- Syntax
        class ClassName {
        constructor() { ... }
        method_1() { ... }
        method_2() { ... }
        method_3() { ... }
        }
        Create a Class method named "age", that returns the Car age -->
    <script>
        class Car1 {
            constructor(carName, buyYear) {
                this.name = carName;
                this.year = buyYear;
            }

            age() {
                let date = new Date();
                return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
            }
        }

        let myCar = new Car1("Alto", 2013);
        document.write("My Car is " + myCar.age() + " years old.<br>")
    </script>

    <!-- You can send parameters to Class methods -->
    <script>
        class Car2 {
            constructor(carName, buyYear) {
                this.name = carName;
                this.year = buyYear;
            }
            age(x) {
                return x - this.year;
            }

        }

        let date1 = new Date();
        let year = date1.getFullYear();

        let myCar1 = new Car1("Maruti", 2000);
        document.write("My Car is " + myCar1.age(year) + " years old.")
    </script>

    <!-- "use strict"
        The syntax in classes must be written in "strict mode".
        You will get an error if you do not follow the "strict mode" rules. -->

    <!-- Example
    In "strict mode" you will get an error if you use a variable without declaring it: -->
    <script>
        class Car {
            constructor(name, year) {
                this.name = name;
                this.year = year;
            }

            age() {
                // date = new Date();  // This will not work
                let date = new Date(); // This will work
                return date.getFullYear() - this.year;
            }
        }
    </script>
