    <!-- jQuery Callback Functions
        A callback function is executed after the current effect is 100% finished. -->

    <!-- jQuery Callback Functions
        JavaScript statements are executed line by line. However, with effects, the next line of code can be run even though the effect is not finished. This can create errors.
        To prevent this, you can create a callback function.
        A callback function is executed after the current effect is finished.
        Typical syntax: $(selector).hide(speed,callback);

        Examples

        The example below has a callback parameter that is a function that will be executed after the hide effect is completed -->
    <button>Click me</button>
    <p>Hey</p>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {
            $("button").click(function () {
                $("p").hide(1000);
                alert("The paragraph is now hidden");
            });
        });
    </script>
