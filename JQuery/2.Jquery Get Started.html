    <!-- jQuery Get Started -->

    <!-- Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
        There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

        Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
        Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google-->


    <!-- Downloading jQuery
        There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

        Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
        Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)
        Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

        The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

        <head>
        <script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
        </head>
        Tip: Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where you wish to use it. -->

    <!-- jQuery CDN
        If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

        Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:

        Google CDN:
        <head>
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
        </head> -->

    <!-- One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:
        Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when
        visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from
        cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time.
        Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from
        it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time. -->
